ENCRYPTION BY MUTILPLE SUBTITUTION
---------------------------------------

REQUIRED 
-------------------------------------
[ for copy automatically coded message ]

pip install pyperclip


for generate encrytion key going to keylib_generator.py, uncomment  #gen_file and run !

-------------------------------------
Init)
I take a character group and divide it into
of them:

group A: to generate the encryption keys
group B: to add characters after the
subtitution


I) Block A
-------------------------------------
the messages are slightly modified by functions.

II) Block B
-------------------------------------
Each character of the message is substituted by a group
of randomly generated characters.

III) Block C
-------------------------------------
characters of group b are chosen randomly
and are added to the already encoded message.


Tips
---------------------------
modify the characters of the initpat.txt file
Put what you want except the characters
that you want to substitute.

Modify the length of the characters generated.

Replace the English word list with a list
word of your language or make up words.

modify the list of frequent letters and put them
frequent letters of your language

This encryption method remains vulnerable
to attacks, do not encrypt your data
personal with this method !!

the code is not perfect and some function
is not explained a next update will fix all its

remember to mix the init pat.txt file using the mixer function in tools in this case delete the __pycache__ folder and regenerate your keys
